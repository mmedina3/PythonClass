# Post an example of code that operates on a list or tuple.
# Examples: slicing a list, slicing from the end, or the beginning, checking if one list is included in another list, copying a list, reversing a list.

#Join lists and sort them

fruits = ['Orange', 'Apple', 'Watermelon']
veggies = ['Potato', 'Carrots', 'Squash' ]

join_lists = fruits + veggies
join_lists.sort()
print(join_lists)
